Description:   USL - User Space Library
  ========================
  USL is a collection of useful routines for building Unix
  applications. We find ourselves writing this stuff over and over again
  each time we write a new application so we collected useful stuff
  together in one place and gave it a silly name.
  USL is released under LGPL.
